Tk::Tree has a dual live on CPAN. Incorporate the 4.3 version.

Port all of Tcl/Tk test suite to Perl/Tk (text.test etc.). t/listbox.t
and t/entry.t was a beginning.

Should Tk::MsgBox be the default messageBox? Are there compatibility
issues?

Check all Tk-related bugs on rt.cpan.org (some are already fixed).

Tk::FBox should deal with 8bit characters in filenames (i.e. use byte
semantics in filesystem operations, maybe use system encoding when
displaying filenames, but with graceful degradation).

What about getOpen/SaveFile and Windows, are there also encoding
issues with filenames?

Minimize diffs to original Tcl/Tk sources to make merging easier.

Port message catalogs from Tcl/Tk to Perl/Tk.

Port tkText*.c changes, as there are some unicode-related fixes.

Widget review (Listbox.pm and Canvas.pm done)

Pod review (Listbox.pod done, options.pod and Canvas.pod in the works,
others pending)

Create a xft test in font.t which tests measures of one or two
populate ttf fonts (e.g. bitstream vera and nimbus).

Try visual c+nmake build on MSWin32.

cygwin build seems to fail if doing in a directory with spaces, eg.
/cygdrive/c/documents and settings/...

Try to build on a mixed 32/64bit platform, e.g. amd64 or x86_64. Strange
errors may occur:
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so when searching for -lX11
/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.a when searching for -lX11
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11
Maybe checking should be stricter here in myConfig?

Documentation:

Create a new document Tk::unicode to explain common pitfalls with
utf8.

Some FAQ entries should go into corresponging Pod documents. Maybe the
rest of the FAQ (renovated!) could go as Tk::faq into the
distribution. (See also ~eserte/src/ptkfaq/faq.html)

Document font('subfonts')?

Tk::tkvars: the versioning scheme documented here was already
abandonded in Tk800 and Tk804. There was a suggestion by Nick
Ing-Simmons to use the minor version as some kind of "API version" and
to have Perl/Tk releases with same minor versions but different major
versions API-compatible. I think this also won't stay, it will simply
be Tk805.000 when a new Tk built on Tcl/Tk 8.5 comes out.

BTW, the VERSIONS file seems to duplicate most of Tk::tkvars.

Either document $Tk::Config::xlib can be used to determine if XFT
support was built in. Or introduce a new variable for XFT and make the
tests use this one.

Mac OS X needs X11INC?

"selection conversion left too many bytes unconverted" panic: may be
reproduced by handling big (>= 4000 bytes) selections (containing
high-bit characters???). To reproduce:

cat ~/.cshrc | perl -MTk -e '{local $/;$sel=<>;} $mw=tkinit; $mw->SelectionOwn(-selection => "CLIPBOARD"); $mw->SelectionHandle(-selection => "CLIPBOARD",sub { $sel });MainLoop'

And then CTRL-V in a Mozilla Textarea.

Check for DTWM_IS_RUNNING property for t/00wmcheck.t

Have a search path for libraries (LOCAL_PREFIX=/.../...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Big projects

Make Perl/Tk thread-safe.

Make a native aqua port.

Port tk8.5.x

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- OLDER ToDos, possibly still unresolved -----------------------------

Debug icon redraw issues on Solaris/olvwm

Add "make strip" target ?

Menubutton Alt-F issues on Win32 - fix or document?

Cache results in MakeDepend?

Do HTML build

Make "compiled" Tk scripts work.

Add one of FontSelect variants (e.g. Tk::FontDialog)

TixGrid repair/replace.

Release tkmail

Start tkdraw ;-)

Non-Sun Drag&Drop (e.g. linux) (Win32 Site now at least partly working.)

Stipple bug, see Message-ID: <2uwCb.683348$pl3.76050@pd7tw3no> (should
be fixed with Tk 8.4.5).

One can't use filenames with high-bit characters in the Photo constructor:
	$photo = $mw->Photo(-file => "high-bit-chars");

Add 'as_default_dir' support for chooseDirectory (similar to
'as_default' for get(Open|Save)File). Documentation missing.

Build and test with older perl releases.
